  # TODO: update times listed here after move to remote backups

  # Since we use sync_first, actual backups only happen at the most frequent
  # ("smallest") backup level, i.e. daily.
  #
  # The other backup levels just promote a daily backup into a weekly/monthly
  # one, so they are comparatively fast.
  #
  # As of 2015-03-29, it takes 30 minutes to do a promotion, and 4 hours to do
  # a full backup. So we leave 2 hours for promotions and 8 hours for a full
  # backup to be safe.
  #
  # It's important that jobs don't overlap, so our plan is:
  #     10pm-12am monthly backup takes place (~30 minutes)
  #     12am-2am: weekly backup takes place (~30 minutes)
  #     2am-10am: daily backup takes place (~4 hours)
