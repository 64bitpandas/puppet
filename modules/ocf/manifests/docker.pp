# Install and configure Docker.
#
# The admin group *must* only contain trusted users (e.g. staff), as Docker
# containers can be used to compromise the host in many scenarios (e.g.
# mounting local filesystems, messing with network interfaces, more readily
# exploiting kernel bugs, etc.).
#
# Containers are helpful for testing things. For example:
#   docker run -i debian:jessie bash
#
# It would be cool to build an image with our base Puppet config to get even
# more use out of them, but that requires quite a bit of work first.
