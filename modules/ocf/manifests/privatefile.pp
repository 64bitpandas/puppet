# This class exists to abstract out accesses to the puppet private share so
# that octocatalog-diff can generally ignore them and replace the file contents
# with dummy contents. It does not and should not have access to the private
# share, since it could accidentally leak secrets and will show output in
# jenkins logs that are public.
#
# Initially this defined type didn't exist and conditionals using the
# $::use_private_share conditional were used around everything that used the
# private share. This worked ok, but led to dependency issues where a resource
# that would normally exist was then hidden behind a conditional and wouldn't
# be seen by octocatalog-diff. This approach is better because it can provide a
# dummy file and a more consistent experience across all usages of the private
# share.
#
# This also gives a convenient interface to enforce file parameters like
# show_diff and backup that we don't want to be set to true for any private
# resources.
