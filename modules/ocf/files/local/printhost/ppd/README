Given the latest hp-laserjet_p4515x.ppd from HPLIP, you probably want to:

patch -o hp-laserjet_p4515x-single.ppd hp-laserjet_p4515x.ppd < single.diff
patch -o hp-laserjet_p4515x-double.ppd hp-laserjet_p4515x.ppd < double.diff

And then use hp-laserjet_p4515x-single.ppd and hp-laserjet_p4515x-double.ppd
as the PPD files for printer-single and printer-double, respectively.

Modifications may be necessary if the patches don't align nicely.
These patches were based off HPLIP 3.12.10a.
