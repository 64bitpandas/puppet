Welcome to the OCF's irc server at irc.ocf.berkeley.edu.
This server listens on port 6697 (SSL only).

We also have a web IRC client all set up to connect to this
server at https://irc.ocf.berkeley.edu if you would prefer
that. Take a look!

IRC is a privilege, not a right. If it is abused, you will be
removed from this server.

Don't be a hoser ;-)

Contact help@ocf.berkeley.edu if you have any questions/comments.
