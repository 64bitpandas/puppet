# Wrapper script for reprepro which sets proper paths and avoids borking
# permissions.
#
# For best results, run under sudo and not as root:
# sudo -u ocfapt /opt/apt/bin/reprepro [...]
#
# Example usage:
#  - reprepro includedeb wheezy my.deb  # add a new package
#  - reprepro list wheezy  # list packages in wheezy dist
#  - reprepro export  # re-export dists (usually not needed)
