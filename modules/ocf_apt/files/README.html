<h1>Open Computing Facility Apt Repository</h1>
<p>
  This apt repo contains packages used by the
  <a href="https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/">Open Computing Facility</a> which
  aren't available from the main archives. Almost all packages are either
  unofficial backports or patches to existing Debian packages.
</p>
<p>
  We're working on providing source packages for the binary packages in this
  repository. In the meantime, if you need the source to any package in this
  repo, please email us at
  <a href="mailto:help@ocf.berkeley.edu">help@ocf.berkeley.edu</a> and we will
  do our best to provide it promptly.

<p>
  This repository is unlikely to be useful to you. Perhaps you're looking for our
  <a href="http://mirrors.ocf.berkeley.edu/">mirrors of the official archives</a>?
